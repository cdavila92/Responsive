                <h3>Short Bio of Norman Borlaug</h3>
                <p>Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 â€“ September 12, 2009)was an American agronomist and 
                   humanitarian who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in 
                   agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his 
                   work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional 
                   Gold Medal. </p>
                <p>Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the 
                   University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position in Mexico, where he 
                   developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties. During the mid-20th century, 
                   Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural 
                   production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of 
                   wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly 
                   improving the food security in those nations. </p>
                <p>Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution", and is credited with saving over a 
                   billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the 
                   president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 
                   article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture that 
                   Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths." He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 
                   in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.</p>
                <p>Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa. </p>
